Those three files are example files fetched from ECB website.
* `euroxfref-daily.xml`: exchange rates on 2024-02-27.
* `eurofxref-hist-90d.xml`: time series file containing last 90days exchange rates
* `euroxfref-hist.xml`: is equal to `eurofxref-hist-90d.xml`, but logically is time series file containing exchange rates for the whole period.
    Copy of `euroxfref-hist-90d.xml` is used instead to save disk space.
